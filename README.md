# Basic Mathematical Operations in Python

This is a simple Python script that performs basic mathematical operations on two user-provided numbers.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Takes two numbers as input from the user.
- Performs and displays:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with zero-division handling)

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The program:
1. Accepts two numbers as input using `input()`.
2. Converts them to `float` for decimal support.
3. Calculates and prints:
   - Sum (`+`)
   - Difference (`-`)
   - Product (`*`)
   - Quotient (`/`), with a check to avoid division by zero.
